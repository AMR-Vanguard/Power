# üöÄ Industrial AMR Project - Power System Design

This repository documents the **power system design and implementation** for our industrial Autonomous Mobile Robot (AMR) project.  
The AMR is designed to carry a **5 kg payload** (total mass **25 kg**) and navigate autonomously using SLAM with a **Jetson Nano** and **LiDAR**.

## üõ†Ô∏è My Contribution

I primarily worked on:

- Selecting motors, drivers, and gearbox based on torque and speed requirements.
- Performing detailed **torque and power calculations**.
- Designing the complete **power distribution system**.
- Selecting and integrating DC-DC converters (boost & buck) to meet system demands.
